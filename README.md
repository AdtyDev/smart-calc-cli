# ðŸ§® SmartCalc: Command Line Calculator with History

This is a simple command-line calculator built with Python that supports basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and stores a history of calculations in a text file.

---

## ðŸ§  Why Build This?

By building this project, you reinforce **core Python programming concepts** such as:

- âœ… Functions and modular programming
- âœ… User input and command parsing
- âœ… Conditional logic (`if/elif/else`)
- âœ… File handling (`read`, `write`, `append`, `close`)
- âœ… Error handling (like divide by zero)
- âœ… Loops and interactivity

Itâ€™s perfect for learners who want to apply their knowledge in a hands-on, useful tool while showcasing clean Python practices.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Stores and displays a history of all calculations
- Clear history anytime using a built-in command
- Validates input format and operators
- Avoids division by zero errors

---

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- File handling and string manipulation
- Command-line I/O

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-calculator-with-history.git
cd python-calculator-with-history

python smart_calc.py
```


**Sample Output**

------- SIMPLE CALCULATOR (type history,clear or exit) ------
Enter Calculation (+,-,*,/) or command(history,check,exit)  10 + 20
Result: 30
Enter Calculation (+,-,*,/) or command(history,check,exit)  history
10 + 20 = 30
Enter Calculation (+,-,*,/) or command(history,check,exit)  clear
History cleared
Enter Calculation (+,-,*,/) or command(history,check,exit)  exit
Bye Bye, See you again!
